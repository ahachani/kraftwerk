## Introduction: 

The scenarios revolve around hypothetical driving situations and whether the driver would accept the coupon immediately, later, or not at all based on factors like location, weather, time, passenger type, and more.

### Overview

The objective is to use visualization techniques and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not.

### Data
The dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning repository through Amazon Mechanical Turk includes attributes like user demographics (gender, age, marital status, education, income), behavioral patterns (frequency of visiting various establishments), contextual attributes (driving destination, weather, time, passengers), and coupon specifics (expiration time, venue type).

### Deliverables
The final report highlights differences between customers who accepted and those who rejected coupons. The analysis involves statistical summaries, visualizations, and Python code to explore the dataset. The findings will be shared in a public GitHub repository as a portfolio piece.

### Data Description
The attributes in the dataset include user demographics, driving context, and coupon attributes, providing insights into user behaviors and preferences in accepting coupons.

### Hypotheses and Acceptance Rates for "Bar" coupon
#### Hypothesis: Drivers accepting Bar coupons might be influenced by factors like age, marital status, and frequency of visits.
#### Acceptance rate for drivers who go to Bar:
The drivers who accepted the bar coupons are most likely either:
-  Drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 and (Acceptance rate = 71.32 %)
-  Drivers who go to bars more than once a month, passengers not kids, and not widowed (Acceptance rate = 72.17 %)

### Hypotheses and Acceptance Rates for "Coffee House" coupon
#### Hypothesis: Drivers accepting CoffeeHouse coupons might be influenced by factors like age, marital status, and frequency of visits.
#### Acceptance rate for drivers who go to CoffeeHouse:
The drivers who accepted the CoffeeHouse coupons are most likely either:
 - Less than 21 years old, single, visiting less than once or more (Acceptance rate = 74.157 %)
- Visiting at least once, at 10 AM, with income between $59K to $62.5K (Acceptance rate = 80 %)
- Female drivers with children and specific occupations (Construction & Extraction, Architecture & Engineering, Protective Service,  and Healthcare Support) (Acceptance rate = 75.00 %)
